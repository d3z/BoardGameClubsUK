## What is this?

BoardGameClubs.uk helps people find board game clubs near them. Search by postcode, browse the map, or filter by day and distance. Every club listing is maintained by the community through GitHub.

## How it works

- The site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- Each club is a Markdown file in the `_clubs/` directory
- Club data is served as JSON and rendered on an interactive [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) map
- Anyone can add or update a club by submitting a pull request

## Adding or editing a club

See the [contribute page](https://boardgameclubs.uk/contribute/) for a full guide on adding a new club or updating an existing listing.

Not comfortable with GitHub? [Open an issue](https://github.com/BoardGameClubs/BoardGameClubs_Web/issues/new) with your club's details and we'll add it for you.

## Running locally

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
