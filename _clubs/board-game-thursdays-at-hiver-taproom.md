  Join us at Hiver Taproom, one of the Top 20 London taprooms, for a relaxed and
  welcoming board game night just minutes from London Bridge. Whether you're coming
  with friends, on a date, or flying solo, there's a wide variety of modern and classic
  board games to choose from. An expert host is on hand to recommend games and explain
  rules. Upstairs, there's a dedicated Blood on the Clocktower social deduction game.
  No experience needed — just grab a drink and join a table.
