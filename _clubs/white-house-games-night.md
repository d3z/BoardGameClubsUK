  A community-run games night that meets on the 2nd and 4th Tuesday each month in a
  village pub, with plenty of folks travelling from the surrounding area too. We bring
  a stash of games along, but you're welcome to bring your own. We play a diverse mix
  ranging from party games, family games, and euro games through to social deduction
  games and the occasional RPG. Regular favourites include Skull, Air Land and Sea, Ra,
  No Thanks, Blood on the Clocktower, and Forest Shuffle. New players always welcome!
