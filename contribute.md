## Adding a Club via Pull Request

If you're comfortable with GitHub, you can add a club directly:

### 1. Create a new file

[Create a new file](https://github.com/BoardGameClubs/BoardGameClubs_Web/new/main/_clubs) in the `_clubs/` folder on GitHub. Name it using the format `your-club-name.md` (lowercase, hyphens instead of spaces).

### 2. Copy this template

Paste the following into your new file and fill in the details:

```yaml
---
name: "Your Club Name"

secondary_days: []
time: "7:00pm - 10:00pm"
frequency: "Weekly"
location:
  name: "Venue Name"
  address: "Full Address, Town, Postcode"
  lat: 53.0000
  lng: -1.0000
cost: "Free"
image: ""
website: ""

### 4. Find your coordinates

To get the latitude and longitude for your venue:

1. Go to [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org)
2. Search for your venue's address
3. Right-click on the map and select "Show address"
4. The coordinates will appear in the URL bar (lat and lng)

### 5. Adding a logo

You can add a logo or image for your club:

1. Upload your image to the `assets/images/clubs/` folder in the repository (PNG or JPG, ideally square and under 200KB)
2. Set the `image` field in your club file to the filename, e.g. `image: "your-club-logo.png"`

Alternatively, you can use a direct URL to an image hosted elsewhere, e.g. `image: "https://example.com/logo.png"`

### 6. Submit a pull request

Commit your file and [open a pull request](https://github.com/BoardGameClubs/BoardGameClubs_Web/pulls). We'll review it and merge it in.

## Updating an Existing Club

Or just **[open an edit request](https://github.com/BoardGameClubs/BoardGameClubs_Web/issues/new?template=edit-club.yml)** and we'll update it for you.
